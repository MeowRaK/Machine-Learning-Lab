# Lab 2: Machine Learning Problem Definition and Data Inspection

## Choosing an Open Dataset

For this lab, an open tabular dataset containing housing data from Ames, Iowa was selected. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features describing residential properties, such as lot size, neighborhood, house style, overall quality, and year built. It is provided in CSV format and is suitable for predictive modeling.

📊 Dataset: [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lespin/house-prices-dataset)

## Defining the Machine Learning Problem

This is a regression problem. The target variable is the house sale price, and the objective is to predict the price of a home based on its features. The model is expected to learn the relationship between property characteristics and sale price in order to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

## Part 3: Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python

The dataset was loaded into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas. The dataset’s shape was examined to determine the number of rows and columns, the first few rows were previewed, and the column names and data types were inspected to understand the structure of the data before preprocessing.

## Part 4: Designing the Methodology Diagram

A methodology diagram was created to visually represent the complete machine learning workflow for this project. The diagram outlines the process from problem definition and dataset selection to data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final results interpretation.  

The workflow also includes an iterative evaluation step, where model performance is assessed and improvements can be made by refining data preprocessing before retraining the model.
